# BUSINESS PROBLEM 


Data Inaccuracy and Errors: Manual entry or poorly integrated systems can result in incorrect or outdated student information, leading to confusion and errors in decision-making.

1.Data Fragmentation: Academic data is often stored across various platforms, such as spreadsheets, paper records, and separate databases, making it difficult to get a comprehensive view of a student’s academic history.

2.Difficulty in Accessing Information: With multiple sources of information and no centralized system, it can be time-consuming for administrators or faculty to retrieve student records when needed, leading to delays in academic planning, interventions, or decision-making.

3.Lack of Insights and Analytics: Without a structured system, analyzing student performance trends, identifying areas of improvement, or monitoring academic progression across different stages becomes a complex and tedious task.

4.Inefficient Tracking and Monitoring: Tracking students' academic progression over time (e.g., from class 10 to post-graduation) is often manual, leading to difficulties in identifying students who may need extra support or recognition.

# INFROMATION SYSTEM OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the INFORMATION SYSTEM are as follows:

1.Centralized Data Management: To centralize and store all students' academic information in one system, making it easy to manage, access, and update data as needed.

2.Efficient Record Keeping: To ensure accurate, organized, and up-to-date records of students' academic history, including class 10th, 12th, graduation, and post-graduation results.

3.Data Integrity and Security: To maintain the integrity and security of student data, ensuring that it is protected from unauthorized access or accidental loss.

4.Data Accessibility: To allow authorized personnel (e.g., academic coordinators, administrators) to access student data quickly and efficiently for monitoring progress and making informed decisions.

5.Automated Reporting and Insights: To automate the generation of reports that provide insights into student performance and progression, helping identify trends, gaps, or areas requiring attention.

6.Support Data-Driven Decisions: To assist in making data-driven decisions regarding student performance, academic interventions, and institutional policies.

7.Enhanced Academic Tracking: To track and visualize individual students’ academic progression, from initial school levels to post-graduation, enabling personalized academic guidance.

8.Improved Communication: To facilitate communication among faculty, students, and administrators regarding academic performance and updates.
 
# WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWCASED 
*THE ACADEMIC PROGRESSION OF 10 STUDENTS HAS BEEN SHOWCASED, WHICH REPRESNTS THAT HOW A STUDENT HAS PERFORMED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. STARTING FROM CLASS 10TH UPTO POST GRADUTION LEVEL. THRIUGH LINE CHART THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STUDENT HAS BEEN SHOWN.


*THE ATTENDANCE OF ALL THE STUDENTS ARE ABOVE 75%WHICH MEANS THAT ALL 15 STUDENTS ARE IN THE RISK FREE ZONE AND CAN APPEAR FOR EXAM.FOR SHOWING ATTENDANCE OF STUDENTS SCATTER PLOT HAS BEEN USED FOR DERIVING CORRECT CONCLUSION.

*COURSE WISE ATTENDANCE OF STUDENT HAVE BEEN SHOWCASED THRUGH BAR PLOTS.

*THE PERSONAL DETAILS OF A THE STUDENTS HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN.

*THE GRADES OF HTE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN THROUGH VISULAISATION. THE TOTAL MARKS ALONG WITH WHICH STUDENT HAS PASSED IN WHICH SUBJECT AND WHICH STUDENT HAS FAILED.

# INSIGHTS 

1.Academic Performance Trends:

The portal provides an overview of student performance across different stages (Class 10, Class 12, Graduation, Post Graduation), allowing administrators to track academic progression over time.

Insights can be drawn about students' improvement or decline in performance at each academic level, helping identify patterns such as consistent high achievers or students who are struggling.

2.Identification of At-Risk Students:

By analyzing the academic data, the portal helps identify students whose performance has dropped or who are consistently underperforming. This allows for timely intervention, such as tutoring, academic counseling, or other support mechanisms.

Students who are falling behind in certain subjects or stages can be flagged for additional academic assistance or personalized learning paths.

3.Performance of Individual Students:

The portal allows for a deep dive into the individual performance of each student, providing detailed reports on their marks, grades, and overall progression. This information can be used for personal academic mentoring and counseling.

4.Academic progression 
By analyzing past academic data, the portal can offer predictive insights into future performance, helping educators and administrators to forecast graduation success or potential challenges faced by students.

# CONCLUSION 
 The visual insights derived from the system—such as performance trends, academic drops, and attendance correlations—enable timely academic interventions and personalized support for students. Moreover, the ability to monitor performance from secondary school through post-graduation gives a holistic view of each student’s academic journey.

From improving academic outcomes to aiding administrative efficiency, the Knowledge Portal represents a scalable, intelligent solution that aligns with modern educational needs. With further development, it holds the potential to integrate predictive analytics, behavioral tracking, and even AI-driven academic guidance—making it a cornerstone of digital education transformation.
